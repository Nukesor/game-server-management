General commands

ttt_version
Prints current version number.

ttt_dropweapon
Will drop your current weapon. By default the key that would open the GMod spawn menu (default Q) instead performs this action. You can manually bind it to other keys using this concommand.

ttt_equipswitch
Switches to slot 7 (your equipment weapon) if you have one. If you have that weapon out, it will instead switch to your previous weapon. So you can quickly toggle to your equipment and back. By default the noclip key (default V) will perform this command if sv_cheats is off (else it will noclip you).

ttt_quickslot [slot number]
Switches to the given weapon slot without having to use the scroll menu. Switches to previous weapon if you already have the slot's weapon out, so the ttt_equipswitch command is basically just "ttt_quickslot 7".

ttt_toggle_disguise
Toggles your Disguiser equipment if you have bought it as Traitor. Default key is Numpad Enter, this command can be used to rebind it.

ttt_spectate
Moves you onto the spectator team. You will not spawn as Terrorist until you use "ttt_spectate 0" to turn this off again. Recommended you use the checkbox in the settings menu under F1 instead.

ttt_print_playercount
Prints the number of players that were alive at the start of the round.
